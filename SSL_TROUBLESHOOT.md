# üîß SSL Error Quick Fix

You're seeing SSL errors because your browser is trying to load HTTPS resources when your server only supports HTTP.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Use Correct URL
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `http://161.35.184.35:5000`
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: `https://161.35.184.35:5000`

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` ‚Üí Clear browsing data
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` ‚Üí Clear cookies and site data
- **Or use hard refresh**: `Ctrl+F5`

### 3. Try Incognito/Private Mode
- This bypasses most browser security restrictions
- **Chrome**: `Ctrl+Shift+N`
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`

### 4. Disable HTTPS-Everywhere
- Turn off any browser extensions that force HTTPS
- Look for "HTTPS Everywhere" or similar security extensions

### 5. Check Your Deployment

Run this on your DigitalOcean console to verify everything is working:

```bash
# SSH into your droplet or use DigitalOcean web console
cd /opt/search_party

# Check if app is running
docker-compose ps

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs search-party

# Test health endpoint locally
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

### 6. Restart Your App (if needed)

```bash
cd /opt/search_party
docker-compose restart search-party

# Or full rebuild if issues persist:
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## Long-term Solutions

### Option A: Keep Using HTTP
- Perfect for testing and internal use
- Always share `http://` links
- No SSL setup required

### Option B: Setup HTTPS (Production)
- Get a domain name (e.g., `searchparty.yourdomain.com`)
- Setup SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt
- Use Nginx as reverse proxy
- Follow the HTTPS setup guide in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome/Edge
- May show "Not Secure" warning for HTTP - this is normal
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to site" if needed

### Firefox
- Disable "HTTPS-Only Mode" in settings
- Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí HTTPS-Only Mode ‚Üí Don't enable

### Safari
- May need to allow "Insecure Content"
- Develop menu ‚Üí Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Try a different browser** (sometimes one browser caches issues)
2. **Check firewall settings** in DigitalOcean dashboard
3. **Verify port 5000** is open and accessible
4. **Test from a different network** (mobile hotspot, etc.)

Your app should work perfectly with HTTP - the SSL errors are just browser security warnings that can be safely ignored for testing/internal use.
